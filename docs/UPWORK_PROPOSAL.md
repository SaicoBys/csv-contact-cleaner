# UpWork Proposal - Pricing Dashboard Project

## Project Details
- **Client Budget**: $8-30/hr (Hourly)
- **My Rate**: $18/hr 
- **Estimated Hours**: 25-30 hours
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
- **Competition**: 5-10 proposals

## Cover Letter

Hi there!

I'm a Python developer specializing in data parsing and dashboard creation. Your pricing dashboard project aligns perfectly with my expertise in turning messy supplier files into clean, actionable insights.

I recently completed a contact cleaning dashboard that processed 1000+ messy records, built an interactive web interface with real-time metrics, and automated data validation. I'd love to apply the same approach to your pricing data.

My rate is $18/hr with estimated 25-30 hours for the complete solution. I can deliver a working prototype within the first week to demonstrate the approach.

Looking forward to turning your supplier chaos into pricing clarity!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Question Responses

### 1. What's your typical approach when normalizing messy product data â€” like multiple ways of writing the same grade or missing column headers?

My approach involves multiple layers:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Use regex to identify common variations (e.g., "Grade A", "A-Grade", "GradeA")
2. **Fuzzy Matching**: Implement similarity scoring to match products with slight differences
3. **Manual Mapping**: Create a lookup table for known variations that can be updated over time
4. **Missing Headers**: Use pandas' header detection and column position analysis to infer missing column names
5. **Validation Rules**: Set up data quality checks to flag unusual entries for manual review

This ensures consistent product identification across different supplier formats.

### 2. How would you structure the app to track historical price changes over time for each product across different suppliers?

I'd structure it with:

1. **Database Schema**: SQLite with tables for Products, Suppliers, PriceHistory, and FileUploads
2. **Unique Product IDs**: Create composite keys combining normalized product name + specifications
3. **Time Series Storage**: Each price entry includes timestamp, supplier, source file, and price
4. **Change Detection**: Compare new uploads against existing data to identify price changes
5. **Trend Analysis**: Calculate price differences, percentage changes, and moving averages
6. **Data Retention**: Keep all historical data with file versioning for audit trails

This allows tracking price evolution and identifying suppliers with frequent changes.

### 3. Given the early scope â€” parsing files, displaying product tables, and showing price trends â€” what tech stack or platform would you recommend and why?

I recommend **Streamlit + Python** for this project because:

**Streamlit**: Perfect for rapid prototyping and iteration. Great built-in components for file uploads, tables, and charts. Easy to deploy and maintain.

**Python Libraries**:
- pandas: Excel/CSV parsing and data manipulation
- pdfplumber: PDF text extraction (better than PyPDF2)
- plotly: Interactive charts and price trend visualization
- sqlite3: Lightweight database for historical tracking

**Why this stack**:
- Fast development and easy expansion
- Great for internal tools (your use case)
- Excellent data visualization capabilities
- No complex deployment requirements

This gives you a solid foundation that's easy to extend with your future roadmap features.

### 4. Can you describe a dashboard you've built before with filters and charts? What were the main challenges and how did you solve them?

I recently built a Contact Cleaning Dashboard with the following features:

**Functionality**:
- File upload with drag-and-drop
- Real-time data metrics (total records, duplicates, validation status)
- Interactive filtering and sorting
- Before/after comparison charts
- Clean data download functionality

**Main Challenges & Solutions**:
1. **Large File Processing**: Implemented chunked processing and progress indicators
2. **Data Validation**: Created regex patterns for email/phone validation with clear error messaging
3. **User Experience**: Added loading spinners and clear success/error states
4. **Memory Management**: Used pandas optimization techniques for large datasets

**Result**: Clean, intuitive interface that processed 1000+ records with visual feedback and downloadable results.

This same approach would work perfectly for your pricing data with added time-series visualization.
